# Plugin

The plugin configuration is the settings which are in the `book.toml` file.

These are all of the options, along with their semantics and default values:

```toml
[preprocessor.files]

# specify name of or path to the binary
command = "mdbook-files"

# path prefix added to all invocations
prefix = "."
```
