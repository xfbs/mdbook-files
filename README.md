[![docs.rs status](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/mdbook-files)](https://docs.rs/mdbook-files)
[![Crates.io version](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/mdbook-files)](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-files)

Preprocessor for [mdBook][mdBook] which renders files from a directory as an
interactive widget, with syntax highlighting.

![Example of mdbook-files](example.png)

## Example

You can run the example by launching `mdbook` in the example directory in this
repository.

```
mdbook serve
```

## Usage

Install `mdbook-files` using `cargo`:

```
cargo install mdbook-files
```

Put the following into your `book.toml`:

```toml
[preprocessor.files]
prefix = "examples"
```

The prefix is a path, relative to which files are to be included.  It is
mandatory to give a prefix. Every include path in the book must be within this
prefix.

You will also need to add the `style.css` from this repository to your list of
extra CSS files:

```toml
[output.html]
additional-css = ["style.css"]
```

To use it, add something like this to your book:

~~~markdown
```files
title = "Files in subfolder"
paths = ["subfolder/**"]
```
~~~

This will produce a widget with all files in `examples/subfolder`, with the given
title. The content of this is a TOML document which contains configuration.
